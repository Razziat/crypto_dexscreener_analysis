# DexScreener Token Listener

## Introduction

This project aims to automate the collection of information on newly listed tokens on the DexScreener mobile app. It uses Appium to interact with the app on a connected Android device and retrieves key data such as token hashes on their respective blockchains, as well as simulated purchases to analyze potential performance.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed and configured on your machine.
- **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**: To communicate with your Android device.
- **Appium Server**: To automate interactions with the DexScreener app.
- **Appium Inspector (optional)**: To inspect the DexScreener app's user interface.

## Installation

1. **Clone the GitHub repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Razziat/crypto_dexscreener_analysis.git
   cd crypto_dexscreener_analysis
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Make sure `requirements.txt` contains all necessary libraries, such as:
   - appium-python-client
   - selenium
   - requests

## Environment Setup

1. Connect Your Android Device

   - Enable Developer Options on your Android device.
   - Enable USB Debugging in Developer Options.
   - Connect your phone to your PC via USB cable.
   - Select MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) mode in the USB connection options.

2. Configure ADB

   - Check that your device is recognized:

     ```bash
     adb devices
     ```

     You should see your device listed with a unique ID.

   - Retrieve your device’s ADB ID to configure it in the script. The ID looks like this: `4672d93b`.

3. Start the Appium Server

   Start Appium Server on port 4725. You can do this via the command line or the Appium GUI.

4. Configure Appium Inspector (Optional)

Appium Inspector is not required to run the scripts but can help inspect the UI.

   - Launch Appium Inspector.
   - Configure connection settings:
     - Remote Host: localhost
     - Remote Port: 4725
     - Remote Path: /wd/hub
   - Import the JSON Configuration:
     - Copy the content from the provided `json_for_appium.json` file.
     - Paste it into the "JSON Representation" field in Appium Inspector.
   - Start the session to inspect the DexScreener app.

## Usage

### 1. Retrieve Latest Tokens

**Script**: `get_newest_tokens.py`

This script retrieves the most recent tokens listed on DexScreener in real-time and saves them to a file.

**Steps**:

- Launch the DexScreener app on your connected phone.
- Select the "New" and "Newest" filters to display the latest tokens.
- Run the script:

  ```bash
  python3 get_newest_tokens.py
  ```

### 2. Simulate Purchases and Retrieve Hashes

**Script**: `dexscreenerlistener.py`

This script interacts with the DexScreener app to:

- Retrieve the 7–8 most recent tokens.
- Extract their hashes on their respective blockchains.
- Prepare a simulated purchase for each token.

**Steps**:

- Make sure the DexScreener app is open on your phone with "New" and "Newest" filters selected.
- Update the ADB device ID in the `dexscreenerlistener.py` script:

  ```python
  options.deviceName = 'your_adb_id'
  ```

- Run the script:

  ```bash
  python3 dexscreenerlistener.py
  ```

**Results**:

- Token information is saved to `pair_hash.json`.
- Simulated purchases are saved to `simulated_purchases.json`.

### 3. Update Token Prices

**Script**: `get_updated_token_price.py`

This script does not interact with the phone. It uses the DexScreener API to:

- Retrieve updated token information.
- Compare current prices with simulated purchase prices.
- Calculate potential gains or losses.
- Display additional data such as liquidity and market cap.

**Steps**:

- Ensure `simulated_purchases.json` exists and contains data generated by `dexscreenerlistener.py`.

- Run the script:

  ```bash
  python3 get_updated_token_price.py
  ```

**Results**:

- Detailed results are displayed in the terminal.
- Data is saved to `purchase_results.json`.

## Future Improvements

- Add effective purchase strategies based on liquidity, market cap, transaction activity, etc.
- Code Refactoring: Split `dexscreenerlistener.py` into multiple files to improve readability and maintainability.
- Performance Optimization:
  - Reduce Sleep Time: Adjust wait times to speed up execution.
  - Improve Algorithm: Optimize how token information is retrieved for better efficiency.
